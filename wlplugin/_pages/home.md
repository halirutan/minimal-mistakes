The Wolfram Language Plugin is an easy-to-install plugin for almost all IntelliJ platform based IDEs, which turns them into a powerful development
tool for Wolfram Language and Mathematica code.
The plugin is designed for package developers who prefer superior editing features, advanced code insight, and an intelligent IDE over
a notebook-based approach.
It integrates seamlessly into the full-fledged IntelliJ platform with project management, version control, and its exceptional code editor.

The strength of the plugin is that it analyses your code on-the-fly which makes it possible to provide intelligent auto-completion not only for
all functions built into the Wolfram Language, but also for local variables, package functions and even symbols from external packages.
You can navigate directly from the usage of your function to its implementation or vice versa.
The Structure View provides a unique way to inspect all package functions and makes navigation to usage messages, attributes, options,
or definitions painless.
Many advanced features like live templates, smart completion, refactoring, and code-folding help you to write correct code at an incredible speed.
This, in combination with the endless features of IntelliJ IDEA, gives you a development experience you never want to miss again.
