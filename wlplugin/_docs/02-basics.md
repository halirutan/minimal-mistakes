All features are directly incorporated into the IntelliJ IDE.
Therefore, by familiarizing yourself with IntelliJ IDEA you will automatically know how to use the plugin for Wolfram
 Language code, because it works consistently for all 
programming languages.
You will find a lot of documentation on [the official Jetbrains site](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/documentation/), but to get a quick start, I suggest the following

* Read through the [Quick Start](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/discover-intellij-idea.html) you find in the official documentation
* Skim at least once through the [Keymap Shortcuts](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/docs/IntelliJIDEA_ReferenceCard.pdf)
* Click some minutes trough the _Tip of the Day_ dialog which shows up when you open IDEA or click on **Help | Tip of
 the Day**
