The Wolfram Language Plugin works with IntelliJ IDEA and a wide range of derived products like, e.g.  CLion, PyCharm, 
RubyMin, Android Studio, WebStorm and many more.
This gives you the opportunity to develop your Wolfram Language code in the IDE that you like the most.
More importantly, however, it allows for the development of packages that use other technologies like `JLink` or 
`LibraryLink` inside an IDE which is most appropriate for Java (IDEA) or C/C++ (CLion).

## Install an IntelliJ IDE

If you start from scratch, download 
[IntelliJ IDEA here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
If you don’t have a licence for the Ultimate Edition, the free Community Edition is also fine.
All IntelliJ products are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
The Wolfram Language Plugin will work with IntelliJ version 2018.3 or newer.

## Install the Wolfram Language Plugin

Once you started your IntelliJ IDE, you will see the initial Welcome screen.

Click on **Configure | Plugins**, search for "Wolfram Language" in the Marketplace tab (IntelliJ 2019 or later) or use
**Browse repositories** (IntelliJ 2018).
If you’ve been using IntelliJ previously, then open the plugins window from **File | Settings | Plugins**.

Install the Wolfram Language Plugin and restart IntelliJ IDEA to finish the installation.
